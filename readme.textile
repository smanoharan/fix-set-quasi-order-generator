h1. README

This is a software package which is 
  able to generate all of the fix-orders of any given group (abstract algebraic structure) 
  and can output the lattice of all fix-orders as a lattice diagram. 



h3. Running the system:
 * Run ./doAll.sh - This places the data from GAP into data/ and then processes each file.

h3. Dependencies:
 * GAP system - for extracting group information from their names 
 * GraphViz - for drawing lattices
